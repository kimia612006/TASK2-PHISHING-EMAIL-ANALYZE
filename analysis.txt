 Mailbox & Sender Analysis
Spoofed sender address: Appears to be from PayPal, but actually from a free Outlook address.
Misspelled domain: epaiypal instead of paypal — a typosquatting trick.

 Urgency & Fear Language
"Response required" and "unusual login activity" are designed to scare the recipient.

 Suspicious Links
Link text says “log in” or “resolution center”, but likely redirects to a fake login page (we can’t verify here but that’s the pattern).

 Grammar & Format Issues
Slightly off formatting. No personalization like your name.

 Final Verdict
This is a phishing email that attempts to steal login information by pretending to be from PayPal. It uses spoofed sender names, urgency tactics, and likely fake links.
